# Plant_disease_classification
Idea: Identify the disease in plant from image. It could help farmers to identify the problem in plants and quickly work on solution to eradicate it.


The dataset for this Image classification project is downloaded from Kaggle. It was once part of Kaggle challenge.
The project has been performed in Google colab to utilise GPU for faster computation. 


Implementation in project:
1) Transfer learning to initiate model with pre-trained weights such as DenseNet121, ResNet50.
2) Custom CNN model to fasten the model fitting without compromising with accuracy.
3) Studied and analysed different techniques for deep learning training - Callbacks, Batch-Normalization, Regularization, Data augmentation
